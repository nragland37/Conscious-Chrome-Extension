# Inspiration

Our project draws its inspiration from the insightful teachings of **Dr. James Curtis**, Department Chair of the Computer and Information Sciences Department at Webster University. Dr. Curtis introduced us to the concept of the **"Triad of Disruption"**, a framework that examines the intertwining of digital social engineering, social media, and propaganda/fake news. This triad forms a potent tool for information manipulation and warfare, leveraged by various entities to influence public opinion and destabilize democracies. Recognizing the power of digital platforms in shaping political narratives, our project aims to demystify and counteract the effects of propaganda, particularly in the realm of political propaganda. By doing so, we hope to contribute to a more informed and conscious digital user.

## Description 

Our Chrome extension is designed to analyze individual tweets, focusing on political propaganda, to assess and display their **propaganda rating**, **reliability**, and **an opposing perspective** within the extension. Through these functionalities, our extension allows users to critically engage with and understand the content they encounter online, empowering a more informed and critical online community.

### Perspective
Provides a message of oppossing perspective generated by the APIs, providing users with a broader view of the narrative being pushed by the source.

  </a>
</div>

<br />

### Propaganda Rating
Utilizes advanced APIs to evaluate whether a source disseminates high or low volumes of propaganda, helping users discern the trustworthiness of the content.

  </a>
</div>

<br />

### Reliability
Analyzes the content to assign a reliability score on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 signifies not reliable and 10 indicates high reliability. This metric aids users in evaluating the credibility of the information.

## Framework and APIs
Built with React JS, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, our extension offers a sleek and user-friendly interface. It integrates the following APIs for enhanced content analysis:

- **GPT-3 & GPT-3.5-Turbo** 
- **TheNewsAPI**

## Process Flow

    Analyzing Tweet Reliability and Perspective
    <br />
  </p>
</div>

The process starts with extracting tweet text via the Conscious extension. This text is then processed by GPT-3 Turbo AI to create a search prompt, which is used to query a news API for relevant articles. These articles, along with the original tweet, are analyzed by GPT-4, which assesses reliability, offers different perspectives, and evaluates propaganda levels. The findings are then displayed to the user through the Conscious extension.
